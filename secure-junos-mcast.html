<p>
Internet multicast introduces a range of new security threats to a
network. These threats are not necessarily any more or less destructive
than those found in unicast-only networks, but they represent a new
class of vulnerability that may be unfamiliar to those with minimal
multicast experience.  The following is a detailed set of recommended
best practices for securing a multicast infrastructure of Juniper
routers.  These recommendations include the most comprehensive set of
features in the industry and are forged by lessons learned after many
years of deployment experience in the world's largest Internet
backbones.

As with all such templates, this one must be modified to fit the
specific requirements of the local network(s) and hosts. It is not wise
to simply cut and paste without a thorough understanding of each
command.

<h2>Calm During the Storm: Best Practices in Multicast Security for JUNOS</h2>
<h3>By Lenny Giuliano &lt;lenny@juniper.net&gt;</h3>

<p>
Originally, multicast deployment recommendations focused on filtering
certain groups that should not be leaked into or out of a network. Some
of these groups are protocol related, some are from legacy applications,
and some are administratively scoped. Examples of these groups include: 
</p>

<pre>
224.0.1.2/32 SGI-Dogfight
224.0.1.3/32 RWHOD
224.0.1.8/32 SUN-NIS
224.0.1.22/32 SRVLOC 
224.0.1.24/32 MICROSOFT-DS
224.0.1.25/32 NBC-PRO
224.0.1.35/32 SVRLOC-DA
224.0.1.39/32 AUTORP-Announce
224.0.1.40/32 AUTORP-Discovery
224.0.1.60/32 HP-Device-Discovery
224.0.2.1/32 RWHO
224.0.2.2/32 SUN-RPC
224.77.0.0/16 Norton-Ghost
226.77.0.0/16 Norton-Ghost
225.1.2.3/32 Altiris
229.55.150.208/32 Norton-Ghost
234.42.42.40/30 Phoenix/StorageSoft ImageCast
239.0.0.0/8 Administratively Scoped
</pre>

<p>
In the past, a list of these unwanted groups was tracked and documented
in draft-ietf-mboned-ipv4-mcast-bcp as providers discovered traffic that
should not have been on the Internet, but that document has long since
expired. 
</p>

<p>
Historically, the primary threat seen on multicast networks has been
Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) storms. Internet worms, such
as Ramen, Slammer, and Sasser, have most often caused these storms.
Typically, these worms infect a host and propagate by using these
infected hosts to discover and attack other vulnerable hosts. To
discover other vulnerable hosts, they usually select a large block of
addresses (such as a /16) at random and port scan all hosts in that
block. In just a few minutes, these infected hosts can scan up to tens
or even hundreds of thousands of other hosts. 
</p>

The coders of these worms often randomly select any IP address range,
inadvertently including IP multicast addresses (224/4) in the possible
range. When packets are transmitted with a destination address in 224/4
on a multicast-enabled network, multicast protocols use this data to
drive the creation of multicast state. For example, when a Protocol
Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) router detects that one of
its locally connected hosts is transmitting multicast packets, it
encapsulates these packets in PIM register messages and sends these
messages to the PIM-SM Rendezvous Point (RP), which keeps the state of
these local sources. The RP then creates an MSDP Source Active (SA)
message for each source-group pair and floods it to all its MSDP peers,
which cache these messages and flood them to all their respective peers,
until MSDP speakers across the Internet have populated their SA caches.
In this way, a single infected host that port scans only a single /16 of
multicast addresses will generate more than 65,000 MSDP SAs that are
flooded and cached by all MSDP speaking routers on the Internet. As more
hosts attack and scan larger blocks of multicast addresses, this state
explosion quickly causes MSDP-speaking routers to run out of memory and
crash. This type of attack, which is not even launched to intentionally
affect the multicast infrastructure, is known as an MSDP SA storm. These
storms are quite easy to launch and have been by far the most common
type of attack seen on multicast networks to date. Juniper has
introduced a number of features in its implementation of MSDP to
mitigate and even eliminate the damage caused by MSDP storms. These
features are described extensively in the following sections.
Additionally, it should be noted that the damage done by MSDP storms is
primarily accidental. That is, attackers damage critical components of
the network infrastructure without even targeting these components. 
</p>

<p>
This document recommends a two-fold approach to hardening a multicast
deployment: first, by enabling features that will reduce or eliminate
the damage caused by attacks, and second, by reducing the size of the
target for accidental attacks by using the concept of whitelisting. The
most common use of filtering in network security involves blacklists.
Blacklists simply contain a list of hosts or services that need to be
denied, while all other hosts or services are permitted. Whitelists, on
the other hand, contain a list of hosts or services that are permitted,
while all other hosts or services are denied. So blacklists allow
everything except what is on the list, while whitelists block everything
except what is on the list. 
</p>

<p>
According to RFCs 5771 and 6308, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) has allocated addresses for global use only from the 224/8,
232/8, 233/8 and 234/8 address ranges. Multicast groups outside these
ranges can be considered reserved from global use, and there is no
legitimate reason to see this traffic on the Internet. Accordingly, this
document recommends allowing forwarding and control traffic only for
groups in these whitelisted ranges. By permitting only 1/4 of the
possible multicast address range to be routed, 75 percent of the
accidental attacks should be prevented.
</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>

<p>
The recommendations listed in this document are supported on all routers
that run JUNOS software. All features and commands mentioned have been
available since JUNOS version 7.6 or earlier.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
This document assumes a multicast deployment that uses static anycast RP
as the RP-mapping mechanism. An in-depth discussion of the operation of
PIM-SM and MSDP is outside of the scope of this document. Additionally,
for full documentation on the JUNOS software commands listed, consult
the <a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos/">JUNOS
Configuration Guide for "Multicast Protocols"</a>.
</p>

<h2>Throttling Multicast Source Discovery Protocol</h2>

<p>
The most obvious method to prevent damage caused by MSDP storms is to
rate limit. However, whenever you rate limit control traffic, you
inadvertently introduce new vulnerability since it is usually impossible
to tell the difference between a good control message and a bad one. For
example, if you blindly rate limit all MSDP (TCP port 639) traffic to 1
Mbps, you simply lower the bar for attack. An attacker must send only 1
Mbps of MSDP traffic to engage the rate limiter, and all legitimate MSDP
traffic is also blocked. Therefore, it is crucial that rate limiting be
as intelligent as possible to deny the malicious, but permit the
legitimate. 
</p>

<h2>Per-Source Limits</h2>

<p>
The most important feature used to achieve intelligent rate limiting is
per-source SA limits. Per-source limits prevent an MSDP speaker from
allowing any single host to generate more than a configured maximum
number of SAs. For example, a per-source limit of 1000 will not allow
any individual host to generate more than 1000 SAs. A worm-infected host
that port scanned a /16 of multicast addresses would then generate only
1000 SAs instead of more than 65,000. The configuration includes both a
maximum and a threshold. SAs are randomly dropped using the random early
detection (RED) algorithm after they exceed the threshold value. MSDP
per- peer and per-instance rate limits use the same threshold and
maximum syntax and behavior. It is difficult to imagine a host that
legitimately sources more than 1000 multicast streams. In the event that
there are known hosts that legitimately transmit more than 1000
multicast streams, these sources can be given larger limits. The
following configuration allows the host 10.1.1.1 to generate up to 5000
MSDP SAs, while all other hosts on the Internet are rate limited to 1000
SAs. 
</p>

<pre>
msdp {
    source 0.0.0.0/0 {
        active-source-limit {
            maximum 1000;
            threshold 900;
        }
    }
    source 10.1.1.1/32 {
        active-source-limit {
            maximum 5000;
            threshold 4500;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
To see the per-source limits as they apply to all known multicast
sources, use the show msdp  source command:
</p>

<pre> 
lenny@paix> show msdp source
Source address 	/Len 	Type 		Maximum 	Threshold 	Exceeded
0.0.0.0		/0 	Configured 	1000 		900 		0
10.10.32.32 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		0
10.14.59.51 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		0
10.14.59.57 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		1243
10.39.0.144 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		0
10.89.2.245 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		13
</pre>

<p>
To see only the hosts that exceed the per-source limits, use the "show
msdp source | except "\ 0" regular expression:
</p>

<pre>
lenny@paix> show msdp source | except "\ 0"
Source address 	/Len 	Type 		Maximum 	Threshold 	Exceeded
10.14.68.99 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		81099693
10.51.171.149 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		540763
10.88.60.37 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		9080
10.88.176.175 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		1144711
10.58.5.249 	/32 	Dynamic 	1000 		900 		425
</pre>

<h2>Per-Peer Limits</h2>

<p>
Per-peer SA limits rate limit the number of SAs received from an MSDP
peer. These limits are functionally analogous to BGP maximum-prefix
limits. The following configuration prevents the router from accepting
more than 100,000 SAs from peer 1.1.1.1.
</p>

<pre>
msdp {
    group eMSDP-peer {
        local-address 2.2.2.2;
        peer 1.1.1.1 {
            active-source-limit {
                maximum 100000;
                threshold 90000;
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
To apply the same per-peer limit to all MSDP peers, use apply-groups. 
</p>

<h2>Per-Instance Limits</h2>

<p>
Per-instance SA limits rate limit the maximum number of SAs that a
router allows in the entire routing instance.  The following
configuration prevents the router from installing more than 200,000 SAs
in its default routing instance.
</p>

<pre> 
msdp {
    active-source-limit {
        maximum 200000;
        threshold 190000;
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Disabling Multicast Source Discovery Protocol Data
Encapsulation</h2>

<p>
To support bursty sources, MSDP SAs may also contain actual multicast
data packets. Typically, the first packet in a multicast stream is added
to the SA. MSDP SAs are placed in inet.4, the routing table that
contains the MSDP SA cache. Additionally, SAs that include encapsulated
data are placed in the forwarding table. The forwarding table generally
has less capacity than the routing table. Therefore, it is recommended
to prevent the creation of unnecessary forwarding table entries, as the
forwarding table is a finite resource that also contains all the unicast
forwarding entries. The following configuration prevents originating RPs
from placing encapsulated data in SAs and ignores the encapsulated data
in SAs received by peers. This sample configuration prevents MSDP from
creating forwarding table entries. Note, however, that the configuration
may have an impact on bursty source applications.  For instance, when
the source transmits one multicast packet is every 20 minutes. If
support for bursty source applications is critical, leave MSDP data
encapsulation enabled. 
</p>

<pre>
msdp {
          data-encapsulation disable;
} 
</pre>

<h2>Multicast Source Discovery Protocol Filters</h2>

<p>
It is important to apply MSDP SA filters on all external MSDP sessions,
inbound and outbound. MSDP SA filters prevent SAs for groups and sources
that should remain inside a network from leaking in or out. At a
minimum, these filters should be applied to all external MSDP peerings.
The following configuration will prevent SAs (for sources and groups
that do not belong on the Internet) from being transmitted or received
by all MSDP peers. 
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
    msdp {
        export sa-filter;
        import sa-filter;
    }
}
policy-options {
    policy-statement sa-filter {
        term bad-groups {
            from {
                route-filter 224.0.1.2/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.3/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.8/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.22/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.24/32 exact;

                route-filter 224.0.1.39/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.40/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.60/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.2.1/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.2.2/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.77.0.0/16 orlonger;
                route-filter 226.77.0.0/16 orlonger;
                route-filter 225.1.2.3/32 exact;
                route-filter 229.55.150.208/32 exact;

                route-filter 239.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
            }
            then reject;
        }
        term bad-sources {
            from {
                source-address-filter 10.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
                source-address-filter 127.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
                source-address-filter 172.16.0.0/12 orlonger;
                source-address-filter 192.168.0.0/16 orlonger;
            }
            then reject;
        }
        term accept-everything-else {
            then accept;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
 
<h2>Multicast Boundaries</h2>

<p>
Apply multicast boundary filters on all customer-facing interfaces by
using multicast scoping. Multicast scoping prevents multicast packets
from flowing into or out of an interface. Apply these scopes on all
interfaces and on all routers in your network, since there is usually no
good reason for these groups to flow on backbone links. The following
configuration prevents multicast data packets from flowing into or out
of all interfaces on the router for groups that do not belong on the
Internet. This configuration also permits data packets in 239/8 to flow
over backbone links, which is necessary on networks that allow 239/8
traffic for internal purposes. 
</p>

<pre>
routing-options {
    multicast {
        scope-policy boundary-filter;
    }
}
policy-options {
    policy-statement boundary-filter {
        term permit-239-on-backbone {
            from {
                interface [ so-0/0/0.0 so-1/0/0.0 ];
                route-filter 239.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
            }
            then accept;
        }
        term bad-groups {
            from {
                route-filter 224.0.1.2/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.3/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.8/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.22/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.24/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.25/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.1.35/32 exact;

                route-filter 224.0.1.60/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.2.1/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.0.2.2/32 exact;
                route-filter 224.77.0.0/16 orlonger;
                route-filter 226.77.0.0/16 orlonger;
                route-filter 225.1.2.3/32 exact;
                route-filter 229.55.150.208/32 exact;
                route-filter 234.42.42.40/30 orlonger;
                route-filter 239.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
            }
            then reject;
        }
        term accept-everything-else {
            then accept;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
 
<h2>Protocol Independent Multicast Bootstrap Router Filters</h2>

<p>
It is extremely important to make sure bootstrap router filter (BSR)
messages do not leak into or out of your network. The following
configuration prevents BSR messages from getting into or out of a
router. Use this configuration on all routers.
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
    pim {
        rp {
            bootstrap-import no-bsr;
            bootstrap-export no-bsr;
        }
    }
}
policy-options {
    policy-statement no-bsr {
        then reject;
    }
}
</pre>
 
<h2>Protocol Independent Multicast Join Filters</h2>

<p>
Multicast scopes prevent multicast data packets from flowing into or out
of an interface. PIM join filters prevent the creation of PIM-SM state,
so multicast traffic is not transmitted across your network and dropped
at a scope at the edge. Also, PIM join filters reduce the potential for
denial-of-service (DOS) attacks and PIM state explosion. PIM join
filters apply only to PIM-SM state. If you use them, apply them to all
routers in your network.  The following configuration will reject PIM
joins sent by neighbors for groups that do not belong on the Internet.
This configuration also permits PIM joins to flow over backbone links,
which is necessary on networks that allow 239/8 traffic for internal
purposes. 
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
    pim {
        import pim-join-filter;
    }
}
policy-options {
    policy-statement pim-join-filter {
        term permit-239-on-backbone {
            from {
                interface [ so-0/0/0.0 so-1/0/0.0 ];
                route-filter 239.0.0.0/8 orlonger;
            }
            then accept;
        }
        term bad-groups {
            from {
                route-filter 224.0.1.2/32 exact;

<h2>PIM Register Filters</h2>

<p>
PIM register filters can be used to prevent unwanted traffic from
creating PIM register state on the RP. These filters can be applied on
the RP as well as on the source's designated router (DR). By filtering
at the DR, the register messages are never sent to the RP. By filtering
at the RP, unwanted register messages sent from any DR will be
discarded. 
</p>

<p>
PIM registers can be filtered based on the source address or group
address. The following example shows a DR filter that allows local
sources in 10.1.1.0/24 to register for groups in 224.1.0.0/16. All PIM
registers for traffic outside these sources and groups will be prevented
from sending registers to the RP. 
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
     pim {
         rp {
             dr-register-policy dr-filter;
         }
     }
}
 policy-options {
     policy-statement dr-filter {
         term permitted-sources-groups {
             from {
                 route-filter 224.1.0.0/16 orlonger;
                 source-address-filter 10.1.1.0/24 orlonger;
             }
             then accept;
         }
         term deny-everything-else {
             then reject;
         }
     }
}    
</pre>

<p>
The following example shows an RP filter that also allows sources in
10.1.1.0/24 to create register state on the RP for groups in
224.1.0.0/16. All PIM registers for traffic outside these sources and
groups from all DRs will be filtered on this RP.  
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
     pim {
         rp {
             rp-register-policy rp-filter;
         }
     }
}
 policy-options {
     policy-statement rp-filter {
         term permitted-sources-groups {
             from {
                 route-filter 224.1.0.0/16 orlonger;
                 source-address-filter 10.1.1.0/24 orlonger;
             }
             then accept;
         }
         term deny-everything-else {
             then reject;
         }
     }
}  
</pre>

<h2>PIM Passive Interfaces</h2>

<p>
When more than one router on a LAN is running PIM, DR election is
performed. The router with the highest DR priority is elected as the DR.
If the priorities are the same, the router with the highest IP address
is usually elected as the DR. On a stub network with only one router, it
may be desirable to ensure that the router is always elected as the DR.
This approach prevents a malicious host or misconfigured router from
hijacking the DR assignment, which can prevent all hosts on the LAN from
sourcing or joining multicast traffic outside the LAN. 
</p>

<p>
To ensure that the stub router becomes the DR and ignores all other PIM
neighbors on the LAN, you can set the hello-interval value to 0. This
setting will simulate a passive interface, where the protocol is enabled
on the interface, but no hellos are transmitted or received on this
interface. Passive interfaces are commonly used with interior gateway
protocols (IGPs), such as OSPF and IS-IS, to accomplish a similar
result. 
</p>

<pre>
protocols {
     pim {
         interface ge-0/0/0.0 {
             hello-interval 0;
         }
     }
}   
</pre>

<h2>Forwarding Cache Limit</h2>

<p>
Inet.1 is the table that contains the multicast forwarding cache, which
includes all PIM entries as well as MSDP SAs with encapsulated data. You
can limit the number of inet.1 entries on the router by configuring a
forwarding cache limit. The multicast forwarding cache is added to the
forwarding table, which the packet forwarding engine (PFE) uses for
unicast and multicast forwarding lookups. The following configuration
limits the number of entries in the forwarding-cache to 150,000. After
this limit is reached, the router cannot add entries until the
forwarding cache drops to 149,000.
</p>

<pre>
routing-options {
    multicast {
        forwarding-cache {
            threshold {
                suppress 150000;
                reuse 149000;
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
 
<h2>Packet Filtering</h2>

<p>
You can use packet filters to deny certain multicast traffic based on
values in the IP header. While scoping blocks multicast data packets
based on group address, firewall filters block data packets based on
values such as source address or protocol. For example, many worms use
TCP packets when they probe. There is no legitimate reason for multicast
TCP packets, so you can deny them on all routers. Filtering illegitimate
multicast traffic such as TCP packets with firewall filters prevents
data forwarding as well as state creation of unwanted traffic.  
</p>

<pre>
interfaces {
     fe-0/0/0 {
         unit 0 {
             family inet {
                 filter {
                     input mcast-packet-filter;
                 }
             }
         }
     }
}
firewall {
     filter mcast-packet-filter {
         term deny-tcp {
             from {
                 destination-address {
                     224.0.0.0/4;
                 }
                 protocol tcp;
             }
             then {
                 count mcast-tcp;
                 discard;             }
         }
         term allow-everything-else {
             then accept;
         }
     }
} 
</pre>

<h2>Routing Engine Filtering</h2>

<p>
Filtering of control traffic to the routing engine (RE) is a critical
step in securing routers. Firewall filters on loopback interfaces
provide this function. In the case of MSDP, only configured peers should
be allowed to send MSDP packets to a router. The following configuration
allows only MSDP packets (TCP port 639) to be sent to the RE if the
source address is one of its configured MSDP peers. Note that the
apply-path command enables this filter to be applied automatically to
all peers configured under MSDP, so this filter does not need to be
edited when MSDP peers are added or removed.  
</p>

<pre>
interfaces {
    lo0 {
        unit 0 {
            family inet {
                filter {
                    input Protect-RE;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
policy-options {
    prefix-list MSDP-Peers {
        apply-path "protocols msdp group <*> peer <*>";
    }
}
firewall {
    filter Protect-RE {
        term MSDP-Allow {
            from {
                source-prefix-list {
                    MSDP-Peers;
                }
                protocol tcp;
                port msdp;
            }
            then accept;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Use the apply-path command for BGP peers as well. The loopback filter
should include all other protocols required to reach the router's
control plane such as PIM, OSPF, Internet Group Management Protocol
(IGMP), SSH, Domain Name System (DNS), Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP), and SNMP. 
</p>

<h2>Session Announcement Protocol Storms</h2>

<p>
Another common source of trouble on multicast networks has been the
Session Announcement Protocol (SAP).  SAP is an advertisement protocol
used by sources to inform receivers of an available multicast session.
Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages are sent over the well-known
SAP group, 224.2.127.254, and contain the pertinent information
describing a multicast session. Receiving hosts can join this SAP group
and learn of available multicast sessions, in a manner similar to
viewing a program guide. 
</p>

<p>
In the past, it was a common practice on many networks to enable routers
to join and listen to the SAP group and cache these SDP messages,
instead of merely forwarding this group to interested receivers. With
SAP listening enabled, you can view the SAP/SDP cache as seen by the
router with the show multicast sessions command.  This functionality has
been used by operators as a quick and easy way to see whether multicast
is working properly on a network. If the router sees a large number of
sessions, then multicast is probably working properly on the network; if
not, something is amiss and further investigation is needed. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, SAP has been a source of many problems. Misbehaving
sources have been known to originate malformed SDP packets that have
crashed routers and receiving hosts. Additionally, misconfigured SAP
servers have been known to multicast the actual data session
accidentally over the SAP group, also crashing routers, firewalls, and
receiving hosts, which were not expecting high-data-rate flows on this
well-known announcement group. 
</p>

<p>
These SAP storms are another example of successful attacks upon the
multicast infrastructure without even trying. Whatever limited, vague
benefits may be gained from enabling routers to cache these messages
have proven in practice to not be worth the risk. Thus, it is
recommended that routers should not listen to the SAP group or cache
these messages. By default, SAP listening is not enabled (set protocols
sap) in JUNOS software, so removing this configuration (delete protocols
sap) or not configuring it in the first place will ensure that routers
will not be affected by SAP storms. 
</p>

<p>
Disabling SAP caching on the routers will have no effect on hosts
interested in receiving SAP announcements.  Routers will continue to
happily forward SAP packets blindly to interested receivers. Some have
suggested policing 224.2.127.254 to some low value such as 1 Mbps to
protect firewalls and hosts as well as downstream routers that still
listen to SAP. As mentioned earlier, simply policing control traffic
actually makes DoS easier.  With a 1-Mpbs policer on all traffic to
224.2.127.254, only one malicious host is needed to send 1 Mbps of bad
traffic to the SAP group to engage this policer and block all legitimate
SAP traffic, effectively killing the SAP service for all hosts. 
</p>

<p>
Note that seeing unwanted traffic on a given multicast group is an
inherent weakness of the any-source multicast (ASM) service model. The
only real way to prevent traffic from unwanted sources is to use the
source-specific multicast (SSM) service model, in which traffic is
forwarded only from explicitly requested sources. The SAP group is a
particularly attractive target for attack since it can be reliably
assumed to have many persistent receivers. In fact, of all the
well-known ASM groups, it is probably the best known and most commonly
joined group. If you still want to protect receivers and firewalls from
unwanted traffic on the SAP group without making it easier to cripple
the SAP service, you can monitor the traffic statistics for each source
for the SAP group to see whether any particular source is sending too
much traffic via the show multicast route group 224.2.127.254 detail
command. This monitoring can be automated using a JUNOS software event
script. If one source is found to be sending excess traffic, a simple
policer can be applied to that source to protect the rest of the SAP
service.
</p>

<pre>
firewall {
     policer sap-policer {
         if-exceeding {
             bandwidth-limit 1m;
             burst-size-limit 10k;
         }
         then discard;
     }
     filter bad-sap-source {
         term one {
             from {
                 source-address {
                     10.1.1.1/32;
                 }
                 destination-address {
                     224.2.127.254/32;
                 }
             }
             then policer sap-policer;
         }
     }
}

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>
The following configuration includes all the aforementioned features
along with a number of optimizations to maximize reuse of policies among
all protocols. It uses the whitelist approach so that only multicast
traffic from assigned address space is forwarded (224/8, 232/8, 233/8
and 234/8), and all other multicast traffic is denied.
